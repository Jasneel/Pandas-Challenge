# Pandas-Challenge Report


The dataset contains 15 schools with a total of 39,170 students. The total budget of all the schools (combined) is $24,649,428. Overall, 65.17% of the students pass the exams. The Charter schools outperformed the district schools as the top 5 hihest-performing schools were Chrater Schools. The budget per each student for Charter schools ranged from $578.00 to $638.00 with an overall passing rate of more than 90%. The budget per each student or District Schools (bottom performing by % overall passing) ranged from $637.00 to $655.00 with an overall passing rate of just over 80%. District schools overall had more students, higher budget per  each student and lower math and reading scores.


Conclusions:
1 -Schools with more students had higher budget per each students.
2 - With higher budgets, the student success showed a continous downward trend of students' average scores (both math and reading) hence decreasing overall passing rate. It makes sense as with higher budgets, most of the budget is usually spent on teacher's wages however, with higher number of students in class, a teacher may not be able to focus on all the students which as a result would decrease motivation to study.
